1) justify why the risk metric is appropriate. 
2) talk about the boundary case (new users, AKA NEWBiEE) where the transaction count is 0. 
3) metric comes from the genesis/initiation block. 
4) state the limitations. 
5) more complex metric to compare to the basic one. 
	- 1 + h/t
	- X + h/t
		- define X
	- 1/t + h/t
		- in that case risk score ranges from 0-2
	- Risk score = T*(T-h)/T if T>0 = 0 if T = 0
		- then higher the risk score is better and everybody starts from 0 reputation and need to work hard to build a reputation
6) say why we didn't take into consideration the profiled transaction history. 
7) in later sections
	- address ID WHATWHATWHATWHATWHATWHATWHAT
		- dont use this
		- use entity or user 
8) conclusion 
	a) 2-3 paragraphs on the solution to the problem 
		- what is the risk score
		- data used
		- process we took 
	b) results of analysis 
	c) discoveries 
	d) learnings
		- like limitations etc. 
	e) based on what we did 
		- what can we conclued
9) don't add cites in the figure captions
