Problem statement:
_________________

We create an authentication protocol that uniquly
verifies the identity and computes a reputation score 
of individual cryptocurrency transactors as a means 
of making the cryptocurrency marketplace more secure and 
trustworthy.

- Protocol scored indiviual(transactor)
- If the score is against the public keys, run rep score agasint the PK?
  - let the person's PK be scored
  - ID of PK is only way to track transactions 
  - Reputation score on PK 
  - Self decleared rep scoreing
    - requirment of the PK holder to maintane his/her rep score 
  - Verified on the BC by the PK holder 
  - Can't be gamed becuase it is on the BC 
  - People can check it but not tamper with it 
  - Vuluntery rep score 
    - Thumbs up/ thumbs down based on transactions 
- Once in block, it can't be tampered with
  - Timestamp
- Block stamps 
  - score get bluid on pointer in bock that become the historical record 
  - blocks have timestamps 
- Membership that allows rep to be a part of the PK ownership 
  - data were authenticated by xyz rep score algotrium
  - can share score with someone becasue it can't be tampered with 
  - only when onwer of that data wants to share
  - someone can ask what it is 
    - entity that was a repo, a PK can set the params to see if the conditions are 
      met in which someone can accpet the score based on the request 
- Bulit into protocol or user wish to participte 
- Average joe would want to control his own scores and see's the reason to do it 
  - Bad actors will get over run by good acters 
- Rep score will flush the bad acters out 
- Initial coin offering
